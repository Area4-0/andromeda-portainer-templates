# The resources.reservation.devices option is not currently available in Swarm. 
# Workaround: specifying the devices is not needed if the default runtime
# of the docker daemon running the container is `nvidia`.
# So we're exploiting 2 conventions here:
# 1. guaranteeing this service is executed on a node having the nvidia capability (via the constraint above)
# 2. guaranteeing all nodes labelled as `node.labels.capabilities.npu==nvidia` have `nvidia` as their default runtime
